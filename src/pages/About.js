      <p>
        The MobileShop website has been in operation since 2011, but its story
        actually began eight years before, when a group of college students and
        friends decided to do business together. We started selling phones in
        stores, but our ambitions, motivations and skills combined, soon focused
        us on new challenges and new markets. The launch of an online store has
        allowed us to build a strong international presence in a number of EU
        countries.
